# Functional Programming

Functional Porgramming is a way of writing software applications using only pure functions and immutable values.

##  Elements of Functional Programming

-  Pure functions & side effects
-  Referential Transparency
-  First Class Functions & Higher Order Functions
-  Anonymous Functions or Lambda
-  Immutability
-  Recursion & Tail Recursion
-  Statements & Expressions
-  Strict & Non-Strict(Lazy) evaluation
-  Pattern Matching
-  Closure


## Main part of function

- Input
- Relationship
- Output

## Properties of pure function

- The input solely determines the output
- the function doesn't change the input
- the function doesn't do anything else execpt computing the output

## Test function as pure function

> Referential Transparency:
> A function is said to be referentially transparent if we can replace it with a corresponding value without changing the program's behavior.

## Why pure function

- Encourage safe ways of programming
- Composable or modular
- Easy to test
- Memoizable
- Can be lazy

## Fisrt Class Function

If you can treat a function as a value, it is a first class Function

- you can assign it to a variable
- you can pass it as an argument to other functions
- you can return it as value from other functions

## Closure

A Function that uses one or more free variables is known as Closure

> In functional programming we creat & pass function similar object in OOP.
> In functional programming, free variable play like state in OOP
