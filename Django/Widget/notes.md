# Widgets
A widget is Djangoâ€™s representation of an HTML input element. The widget handles the rendering of the HTML, and the extraction of data from a GET/POST dictionary that corresponds to the widget.

The HTML generated by the built-in widgets uses HTML5 syntax, targeting <!DOCTYPE html>. For example, it uses boolean attributes such as checked rather than the XHTML style of checked='checked'.

## Specifying widgets
Whenever you specify a field on a form, Django will use a default widget that is appropriate to the type of data that is to be displayed. To find which widget is used on which field, see the documentation about Built-in Field classes.

However, if you want to use a different widget for a field, you can use the widget argument on the field definition. For example:
```
from django import forms

class CommentForm(forms.Form):
    name = forms.CharField()
    url = forms.URLField()
    comment = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea)
```
This would specify a form with a comment that uses a larger Textarea widget, rather than the default TextInput widget.

## Setting arguments for widgets
Many widgets have optional extra arguments; they can be set when defining the widget on the field. In the following example, the years attribute is set for a SelectDateWidget:

```
from django import forms

BIRTH_YEAR_CHOICES = ['1980', '1981', '1982']
FAVORITE_COLORS_CHOICES = [
    ('blue', 'Blue'),
    ('green', 'Green'),
    ('black', 'Black'),
]

class SimpleForm(forms.Form):
    birth_year = forms.DateField(widget=forms.SelectDateWidget(years=BIRTH_YEAR_CHOICES))
    favorite_colors = forms.MultipleChoiceField(
        required=False,
        widget=forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple,
        choices=FAVORITE_COLORS_CHOICES,
    )
```
See the Built-in widgets for more information about which widgets are available and which arguments they accept.
